  <h2>Project Management</h2>
  <p>Before you can begin working on your project, you must have a clear idea of what the project is. 
  This means that you need to think of the project requirements, possible implementation and how much time
  you have to complete the project</p>
  <p>Spiral development is very important. You work based on the time available and come back to improve your 
  project if time permits</p>
  <h2>Web Development</h2>
  <p>The language of the web is html. Documents are written in plain text, with html tags, which control the format 
  & appearance of the document on a web browser</p>
